# Skill Files Feedback

## What Works Well

1. **YAML frontmatter** - `allowed-tools` makes it clear what's available
2. **Quick examples** - Concrete examples > abstract descriptions
3. **Use cases** - "When to use this" sections are helpful

## What Could Be Better

1. **No cross-references** - Skills don't mention related skills
   - e.g., types skill could mention syntax skill for editing

2. **Missing error handling examples** - What to do when tool fails

3. **No workflow examples** - Multi-step patterns like:
   - "Run tests → Fix failures → Run again"

## Suggestions

1. Add "Related skills" section to each skill
2. Add "Common workflows" with step-by-step examples
3. Add "Troubleshooting" section for common issues
